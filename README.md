This is a concert ticket buyer interface that I designed and created for SWDV 640: User Interface Design at Maryville University.

In addition to the website, this repository contains a style guide and prototype. The prototype was created using Balsamiq Wireframes.

The website does not require any installation, beyond the files in the website folder, to be viewed. The website utilizes HTML, LESS, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and mustache.js templating.
